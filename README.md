# Vanilla JS Weather App
Vanilla Javascript Weather App created as the final project on SheCodes Plus Course

I started SheCodes Plus in May 2020. Before that I had no experience with writing any sort of code. And then everything just... clicked. Programming makes so much sense inside my head. My mind is very logical, and it just fitted perfectly.
This weather app is the project required to complete the course. It is built entirely in Vanilla Javascript only because that was the course's goal. In another repository you can find the same weather app built using a Javascript Framework.

Feel free to make sugestions, ask questions, and please, use this code for your own projects if necessary.

The app is hosted right [here](https://vanilla-js-weather-app-84.netlify.app/)

Have fun playing with my very first Javascript project!

Thanks for reading this.

Have a great day,
Didi Bonocore.
